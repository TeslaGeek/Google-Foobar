# Google-Foobar

Hello fellow programmers

My encounter with Google Foobar was through an unseal channel and it may not apply to a few of you who have come here. I applied for a senior UX position in Google in May 2022 and the interview process took about 6 months. As I was going through the last stages of interviews and communicating with the recruiter, I noticed an unusual binary code at the bottom of her email (the signature section of the email). I converted the binary code to text, and the text was an address to a website. The website was in fact the foobar challenge terminal and unsurprisingly it knew my credentials and allowed me to log in. 

This repository presents the Foobar challenges I were given and my solutions to the challenges written in python 2.7. 

I have got one free referral link to anyone who may be interested to participate in the Foobar challenge so please get in touch if you would like to push your programming, logical, mathematical, and creative skills. 

# What is the Google Foobar Challenge

Google Foobar challenge is a set of programming challenges. After searching Online, I learned that Google has used the challenge as recruiting tool to find candidate developers to hire. Indeed, there's a recruitme command available once you reach the level 3 and above. However, as mentioned above this is not how I came across this challenege. The Footbar challenge consists of a sci-fi adventure story where you are the hero trying to stop an evil antagonist from destroying a planet solving programming challenges of increasing difficulty to advance the plot.

# Notes

* Since many of the problem statements included explicit instructions about the parameters of the problem, I expected that the verification tests would include invalid or out-of-bounds input data. I quickly realized that the verification tests are only checking corner cases to make sure that you implement the algorithm correctly. In the interests of focusing on the solution and time saving, I omitted any bounds checking or assertions that weren't absolutely required.

* Although not explicitly mentioned in python instructions in constraints.txt file for each challenge, the time complexity is a key issue in foobar coding. There could be many algorithms to solve each challenge however, the algorithm with less complexity and exceution time will pass the tests. If your code passes the given tests by the challenge and fails on tests run on the server, it is likely that your code's execution time is too high.

* Each challenge is authored to target a single algorithm or technique. Some were already known to me, others required a bit of learning which was fun. I used this as my guide: if my proposed approach was too complicated, I looked for something simpler.
