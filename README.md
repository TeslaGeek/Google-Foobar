# Google-Foobar

Hello fellow programmers

My encounter with Google Foobar was through an unseal channel and it may not apply to a few of you who have come here. I applied for a senior UX position in Google in May 2022 and the interview process took about 6 months. As I was going through the last stages of interviews and communicating with the recruiter, I noticed an unusual binary code at the bottom of her email (the signature section of the email). I converted the binary code to text, and the text was an address to a website. The website was in fact the foobar challenge terminal and unsurprisingly it knew my credentials and allowed me to log in. 

This repository presents the Foobar challenges I were given and my solutions to the challenges written in python 2.7. 

I have got one free referral link to anyone who may be interested to participate in the Foobar challenge so please get in touch if you would like to push your programming, logical, mathematical, and creative skills.
